    Scenario: 6: Non-agreement to diagnostic tests

    S1-S9-S10-S43-A8-A183-A25-J28-J30-A25-(A50)-J10-A100-(A167)-A38-A168-C203 [SSCL7a] J10-A99-A165-A168-C203 [SSCL8a]

    This scenario tests where a subject is suitable but refuses to have a diagnostic test.  This tests both routes to this discharge - one where the patient makes an immediate decision (A38 route) and one where the subject asks for time to consider but does not make a decision within the time limit (A165 route).  It also tests both in-age and over-age closures, and the "further review" functionality of a colonoscopy assessment dataset, where the suitability chosen from the Advance Episode screen does not match with the suitability stored in the dataset.

    Scenario summary:

    > Create a new subject in the FOBT age range > Inactive
    > Run the FOBT failsafe trawl > Call
    > Run the database transition to invite them for FOBT screening > S1(1.1)
    > Process S1 letter batch > S9 (1.1)
    > Run timed events > creates S9 letter (1.1)
    > Process S9 letter batch > S10 (1.1)
    > Log kit > S43 (1.2)
    > Read kit with ABNORMAL result > A8 (1.3)
    > Invite for colonoscopy assessment > A183 (1.11)
    > Process A183 appointment letter > A25 (1.11)
    > SC DNA appointment > J28
    > Rebook colonoscopy assessment > J30 (1.11)
    > Process J30 letter > A25 (1.11)
    > Record diagnosis date (A50)
    > Attend assessment appointment > J10 (1.11)
    > Suitable for radiology > A100 (1.12)
    > Process A183 result letter (A167)
    > Decision not to proceed > A38 (1.12)
    > Process A38 letter batch > A168 (1.12) > C203 (1.13)
    > Check recall [SSCL7a]
