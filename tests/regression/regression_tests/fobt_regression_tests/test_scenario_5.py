    Scenario: 5: DNA colonoscopy assessment twice

    This scenario tests where the patient is discharged from their FOBT episode because they DNA their colonoscopy assessment appointment twice. It also tests the diagnosis date and kit result letter spur events.

    Scenario summary:

    > Create a new subject in the FOBT age range > Inactive
    > Run the FOBT failsafe trawl > Call
    > Run the database transition to invite them for FOBT screening > S1(1.1)
    > Process S1 letter batch > S9 (1.1)
    > Run timed events > creates S9 letter (1.1)
    > Process S9 letter batch > S10 (1.1)
    > Log kit > S43 (1.2)
    > Read kit with ABNORMAL result > A8 (1.3)
    > Invite for colonoscopy assessment > A183 (1.11)
    > Process A183 appointment letter > A25 (1.11)
    > Patient DNA appointment > J11 (1.11)
    > Process J11 letter batch > J27 (1.11)
    > Rebook colonoscopy assessment > A184 (1.11)
    > Process A184 letter > A26 (1.11)
    > Patient DNA appointment > A185 (1.11)
    > Process A185 letter batch > A37 (1.11)
    > Process A37 letter batch > A166 (1.11) > P202
