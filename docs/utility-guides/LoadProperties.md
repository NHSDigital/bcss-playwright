## How This Works

This utility uses the `jproperties` package to load the properties files.<br>
There is a class `PropertiesFile`, containing the locations of both files:

1. `self.smokescreen_properties_file`: tests/smokescreen/bcss_smokescreen_tests.properties
2. `self.general_properties_file`: tests/bcss_tests.properties

The method `get_properties()` will load either one of these based on the input provided.<br>
To ensure that there are no mistakes when providing this input there are two additional methods to call that will do this for you:

1. `get_smokescreen_properties()`: Which will load `self.smokescreen_properties_file`
2. `get_general_properties()`: Which will load `self.general_properties_file`

To add values to the properties file follow the format:

    # ----------------------------------
    # EXAMPLE VALUES
    # ----------------------------------
    example_value_1=value1
    example_value_2=value2

## Using the Load Properties Utility

To use the this utility in a test reference the pytest fixture in `conftest.py`.<br>
There is no need to import anything as any fixtures in `conftest.py` will be automatically discovered by pytest.
Here there are two fixtures:

1. `smokescreen_properties` - which is used to load the file: tests/smokescreen/bcss_smokescreen_tests.properties
2. `get_general_properties` - which is used to load the file: tests/bcss_tests.properties

## Example usage

    def test_example_1(page: Page, general_properties: dict) -> None:
        print(
            general_properties["example_value_1"]
        )
